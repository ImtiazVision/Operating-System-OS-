**Operating System (OS)** : Applications can share memory, they can communicate with hardware, and many other cool things are made possible by a large body of software. This software is responsible for making it possible to execute numerous programs simultaneously. The operating system (OS) is the software that ensures that the system runs smoothly and effectively while being simple to use.

**Concurrency** : is a conceptual word refers to a number of issues that develop while working on many projects simultaneously in the same application. With virtualization, the operating system is juggling multiple tasks at once, executing one process after another. As it turns out, this causes some profound and intriguing issues.

**Abstraction** : One of the main aims of constructing abstractions is to make the system more user-friendly. Abstractions are essential in computer science. In other words, we may create a huge program in a high-level language like C, Python, or Java without worrying about the underlying assembly, or design a processor out of gates without worrying about transistors.
